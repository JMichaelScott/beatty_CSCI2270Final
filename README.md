## Team
Dawson Beatty, working alone

## Project
Will be making a rudimentary spell checker, using a giant tree of more than 100,000 English words. Going to organize based on length of word, with each lower level of the tree representing a longer word. 

Possible problems include efficiently searching such a large structure, and organization.
